# Data

Data generated from simulation is stored in `csv`. There, `meta_` files refer to blocks of big datasets for `training`, `evaluation` and `real evaluation`.

Images in `heightmaps` were rendered as elevation maps in simulation for data generation.

Data generated for the rotation classifier is stored in `rotate` folder.

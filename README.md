## Learning Ground Traversability from Simulations

Mobile ground robots operating on unstructured terrain must predict which areas of the environment they are able to pass in order to plan feasible paths.
We address traversability estimation as a heightmap classification problem: we build a convolutional neural network that, given an image representing the heightmap of a terrain patch, predicts whether the robot will be able to traverse such patch from left to right.
The classifier is trained for a specific robot model (wheeled, tracked, legged, snake-like) using simulation data on procedurally generated training terrains; the trained classifier can be applied to unseen large heightmaps to yield oriented traversability maps, and then plan traversable paths. We extensively evaluate the approach in simulation on six real-world elevation datasets, and run a real-robot validation in one indoor and one outdoor environment.

## Data

This folder contains the heightmaps (gray-scale images) and the csv files with the data from each simulated trajectory.


## Code

In this folder we provide several sub-folders for each module of our traversability estimation framework:

### Simulation

Code for simulating the Pioneer 3AT robot on a generated heightmap.

This code can be accessed as a docker image that setups all the needed libraries:

> `docker pull romarcg/traversability-ros-ubuntu-gazebo`

or by copying the `simulation` folder files to an existing `ros+gazebo` setup.

### Heightmap generation

Contains a document explaining in detail the procedural generation of heightmaps and a script that implements such procedure.

### Dataset generation

Contains a script that takes a csv file and builds a `dataframe` that is used to generate the training/evaluation/real-evaluation dataset.

### Training

Contains a script that builds the CNN architecture, takes the dataset generated by the previous script and starts the network training (this task may take several hours). In addition, a report of common metrics is provided as evaluation of the trained CNN.

The model generated by this script is saved to be used in future scripts.

> An already trained model file is provided to avoid the training step.

### Evaluation

This script computes oriented traversability maps and minimal traversability maps using the trained model on unseen (testing) heightmaps.

### Visualization

This script processes traversability maps and generates 3D renderings to interactively examine a heightmap and its estimated map.

> A set of already generated traversability maps is provided as sample files to avoid regenerating them.


### Software requirements

In order to use the provided scripts, these are the list of requirements:

  * python 3.5.3
  * numpy 1.12.1
  * matplotlib 2.0.0
